Crop Recommendation System This project implements a Crop Recommendation System using machine learning techniques to assist farmers in selecting the most suitable crop for their land, based on key agricultural parameters. The system aims to enhance productivity and support sustainable farming practices.

üìã Project Overview Agriculture plays a vital role in the global economy, and selecting the right crop is essential for maximizing yield and reducing resource wastage. This Crop Recommendation System leverages machine learning models to predict the most appropriate crop based on the given environmental and soil conditions.

Features Analyzes soil properties, climate data, and other parameters. Recommends crops such as rice, wheat, maize, etc., based on historical agricultural data. Provides an interactive interface for users to input their data and view results.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used Python: Programming language used for implementation. Pandas & NumPy: For data cleaning, preprocessing, and manipulation. Matplotlib & Seaborn: For visualizing patterns in the dataset. Scikit-learn: For building and training machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, Decision Trees, SVM). Jupyter Notebook (IPYNB): For implementing and testing the system interactively. üìä Dataset The dataset includes:

Soil Properties: pH, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium levels. Weather Parameters: Temperature, humidity, rainfall. Labels indicating the optimal crop for the given parameters.

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works Data Preprocessing: Cleans and normalizes data for machine learning. Feature Engineering: Selects key features affecting crop yield. Model Training: Trains a machine learning model to classify crops based on input data. Prediction: The model predicts the most suitable crop for the input conditions. Evaluation: Evaluates model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
